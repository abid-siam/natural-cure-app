# Project Name
Natural Cure—A Holistic Healthcare Software

# Overview 
Natural Cure is a project in the field of software engineering. It requires knowledge of the best practices in natural medicine as well. The users of the Natural Cure software system will be able to input symptoms/problems and receive personalized treatment options over the internet. All remedies are based on natural medicine and free from pharmaceutical drugs. 
	
# Research, Design, or Technical Issues Involved or Addressed
“Natural Cure” is the answer to the need for a more holistic healthcare system. It will be a software system, which can be accessed over the internet on a website or through an app on a smartphone, where the user describes his/her problems and symptoms. The user is then asked a few brief questions based on the descriptions provided. Then natural remedies are suggested tailored for each user’s lifestyle and environment. The user can track his/her progress and provide updates. The user should not experience any side effects as all treatment suggestions are “human-friendly” and natural. Even if the suggested plan does not help in alleviating the symptoms, at least the user will not have another undesirable side effect to deal with. If, after the specified course of action, the user does not find relief, then an alternate course is suggested. The user also has access to numerous articles and links to websites dedicated to healthy lifestyle practices.
	
# Goals
The goal of this project is to use the tools of computing and information technology to improve healthcare. Diagnostic tools incorporating machine learning can prove to be more accurate and reliable. The ethos of this project is the belief that every disease that exists on this planet has a cure for it hidden in nature or natural activities. Therefore, we want to revolutionize the field of natural medicine with the help of computer science and engineering.
